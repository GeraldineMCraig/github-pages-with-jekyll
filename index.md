# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. My name is Geraldine and this is my GitHub blog with the Jekyll theme. I'd love a collaboration with you in regards to programming! My areas of interest include creative arts, photography, pilates, yoga, fashion and travel.

Connect with me and perhaps we can create something facinating and beautiful!
